## Machine Learning

This repository serves as my personal [notes](lecture-notes.md), implementations, and explorations of various machine learning concepts.

### Lecture Series
Participated in the [deep learning lecture series](http://www.boltzmann-institute.com/) offered by Neg Ruggeri/the Boltzmann Institute from October - December 2017.

Topics:
1. Linear and Logistic Regression.
2. Gradient Descent.
3. Feed Forward Neural Networks: multilayer perceptrons and backpropagation.
4. Convolutional Neural Networks (image recognition).
5. Recurrent Neural Networks (natural language processing).
6. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells. Word embeddings (word2vec).
7. Sequence to Sequence tasks. Encoder/Decoder architecture. Machine translation.
8. Autoencoders. Unsupervised representation learning.
9. Generative Adversarial Networks (image and music synthesis).

### Neural Network Implementations

Initially, I will implement the above techniques with Keras and TensorFlow. The aim is to learn through a variety of projects, enough to be able to explore original ideas.
